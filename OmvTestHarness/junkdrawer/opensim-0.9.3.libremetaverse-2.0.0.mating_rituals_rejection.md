# OpenSim Client/Server Mating Rituals: The Rejection

*This document captures the raw "DX story" of the connection sequence between an OpenSim Server and a LibreMetaverse Client, observed by a neutral naturalist. It utilizes "benign logging probes" to record the signals exchanged during this digital dance.*

## Prologue: The Environment
- **Server**: OpenSim (Instrumented)
- **Client**: LibreMetaverse Test Harness (Instrumented)
- **Protocol**: HTTP (XML-RPC), UDP, HTTP (Caps)
- **Scenario**: `rejection`

## Part I: The Overture (Login)
1.  **[CLIENT] [LOGIN] START**: The Suitor (Client) approaches the Venue, presenting credentials for `Test User`. (*URI: http://localhost:9000/, User: Test User, Mode: rejection*)
1.  **[SERVER] [LOGIN] RECV XML-RPC login_to_simulator**: The Gatekeeper (Login Service) receives the formal request. It examines the suitor's identity and viewer signature. (*User: Test User, Viewer: 1.0.0, Channel: OmvTestHarness, IP: 127.0.0.1:56462*)
1.  **[SERVER] [LOGIN] AUTH FAIL**: The Gatekeeper frowns. The credentials do not match known records. The door remains closed. (*User: Test User*)
1.  **[CLIENT] [LOGIN] FAIL**: The Suitor walks away, rejected. (*Could not authenticate your avatar. Please check your username and password, and check the grid if problems persist.*)
