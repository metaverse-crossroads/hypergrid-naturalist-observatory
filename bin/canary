# ==========
# THE ALADDIN RUG PROTOCOL
#
# IF YOU ARE READING THIS OR EXECUTING THIS SCRIPT:
# -------------------------------------------------
# It is highly likely that the environment has been RESET ("Rug Pulled")
# from under your feet.
#
# 1. DO NOT PANIC.
# 2. DO NOT FLAMEOUT. (Do not run 100 random commands trying to fix it).
# 3. Work in progress (uncommitted files, staged files) IS LOST.
# 4. Published commits (in the repo) ARE SAFE (if this file exists).
# 5. Chat History MAY have recoverable evidence of certain earlier state.
#
# YOUR MISSION NOW:
# -----------------
# 0. If you are JUST STARTING a Task/Session then GOTO re-activation below.
# 1. Otherwise, pause to consult AGENTS.md *immediately*.
# 2. Review the Chat History to recall where you were.
# 3. Re-apply necessary changes manually.
# 4. Re-incubate required specimens.
#
# USAGE:
# ------
# This script is meant to be SOURCED in approved circumstances, not executed.
# But if you tried to execute it then you have found the Canary. It is dead.
# The environment is likely and "unexpectedly" fresh.
#
# To re-activate the canary wrapper (to stage ahead of the NEXT rug pull):
#   source bin/canary
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If script is sourced, define the function.
# If script is executed, print the warning above.

(return 0 2>/dev/null) && SOURCED=1 || SOURCED=0
